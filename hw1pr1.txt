Pattern recognition and algorithmic thinking stick out to me the most. Recognizing patterns is what the brain does for us automatically. A pattern I follow to solve a problem in the morning is brushing my teeth. I wake up with morning breath, I brush my teeth. I also use algorithmic thinking everyday. When I cook, it’s always the same. I get ingredients, mix ingredients, cook ingredients and eat.
