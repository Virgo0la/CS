Exercise 1 
Part 1. 
I think the only obstacles Picobot could run into are the four blue walls. Unless Picobot can’t go back over the area they have already covered. 15 different surrounding possibilities. 
The internal state is 0 
Part 2. 
If Picobot starts in the lower left hand corner. I would make Picobot move right 22 steps then move up one. Then to the left 22 spaces, then up one. I would repeat this until all spaces are cleared.






Exercise  2


1. Yes, since Picobot didn’t start in the lower left hand corner. They will only be blocked off by one side rather than two. I think I can reuse my plan from exercise one with only a few tweaks. I would only need to change how many steps the move to the left or right from their starting position.
